## Running with Docker

To run all required services, please execute the [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) file in the root of this repository.

```bash
docker compose up
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to open the application.

### Production Considerations

- The application requires HTTPS in production for authentication to work properly.
- update .env-test, especially the `AUTH_SECRET` variable to make sure all passwords have a unique hash, not similar to this demo environment variable.
