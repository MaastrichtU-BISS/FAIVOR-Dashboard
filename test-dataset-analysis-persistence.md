# Test Plan for Dataset Analysis Persistence

## Overview
The dataset characteristics analysis (auto-generated statistics, distributions, and visualizations) is now saved and restored when reopening a validation.

## What Was Implemented

1. **Updated Validation Types** (validation.ts)
   - Added `datasetAnalysis` field to `dataset_info` interface
   - Includes all statistics, column analysis, and distribution data

2. **Enhanced Validation Store** (validation.store.ts)
   - Added `datasetAnalysis` to ValidationFormState
   - Added methods: `setDatasetAnalysis()`, `getDatasetAnalysis()`, `clearDatasetAnalysis()`

3. **Updated DatasetVisualization Component**
   - Added `onAnalysisComplete` prop to emit analysis results
   - Added `existingAnalysis` prop to use saved analysis without re-processing
   - Component now checks for existing analysis before analyzing CSV

4. **Enhanced DatasetCharacteristicsStep**
   - Captures analysis results via `handleAnalysisComplete()`
   - Passes existing analysis to DatasetVisualization
   - Stores analysis in validation form store

5. **Updated Data Transformation** (validation-transform.ts)
   - `formDataToValidationData()` now includes dataset analysis in saved data
   - `validationJobToFormData()` restores dataset analysis when loading
   - ValidationModal sets dataset analysis when loading existing validation

## Test Steps

1. **Create New Validation with Dataset Analysis**
   - Go to a model page
   - Click "New Validation"
   - Upload a CSV file in Step 1
   - Go to Step 2 (Dataset Characteristics)
   - Wait for the auto-generated analysis to complete
   - Note the statistics, distributions, and visualizations
   - Complete and save the validation

2. **Verify Data is Saved**
   - Check browser console for logs:
     - "ðŸ“Š Dataset analysis completed"
     - "ðŸ“Š formDataToValidationData - dataset analysis to save"
     - Should show the full analysis object being saved

3. **Reopen Saved Validation**
   - Go back to the model page
   - Click on the saved validation to view it
   - Navigate to Step 2 (Dataset Characteristics)
   - Verify the analysis displays immediately without re-processing
   - Check console for: "ðŸ“Š Restored dataset analysis from storage"

## Expected Results

- Dataset analysis (statistics, distributions, visualizations) should be preserved
- When reopening, analysis should display immediately without re-analyzing the CSV
- All charts and statistics should match what was shown after initial upload
- Performance improvement: no re-processing of large CSV files

## Benefits

1. **Performance**: Large CSV files don't need to be re-analyzed
2. **Consistency**: Users see the same analysis every time
3. **Offline Access**: Analysis available even if CSV file is removed from IndexedDB
4. **User Experience**: Instant display of analysis when viewing saved validations
