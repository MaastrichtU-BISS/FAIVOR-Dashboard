# Test Plan for Column Pairing Data Persistence

## Test Steps

1. **Upload CSV with Column Pairing**
   - Go to a model page
   - Click "New Validation"
   - Upload a CSV file in the Dataset step
   - Observe the column mapping display
   - Note the CSV columns and how they map to model columns
   - Complete the validation and save

2. **Verify Data is Saved**
   - Check browser console for logs:
     - "ðŸ“Š Extracted column pairing data"
     - "ðŸ“Š Column pairing data being stored in database"
     - "âœ… Verified column pairing data in saved validation"

3. **Reopen Saved Validation**
   - Go back to the model page
   - Click on the saved validation to view it
   - Navigate to the Dataset step
   - Verify the column mapping display shows the same mappings as before
   - Check console for: "ðŸ“Š Found saved column pairing data"

## Expected Results

- Column pairing data should be preserved when saving
- When reopening a validation, the column mapping should display exactly as it did after CSV upload
- The mapping should show:
  - CSV column names
  - Model column names
  - Correct pairing relationships
  - Categorical indicators

## What Was Fixed

1. **Data Transformation**: Updated `formDataToValidationData()` to extract and save column pairing details from validation results
2. **Data Restoration**: Updated `validationJobToFormData()` to restore column pairing data when loading saved validations
3. **API Logging**: Added verification logging in the API endpoint
4. **UI Display**: Updated DatasetStep.svelte to show saved column mappings when no active CSV validation is present

The fix ensures that all validation data (including column mappings) is properly persisted in the database's JSONB `data` column.
