1. Standardizes model validation against FAIR principles
2. Provides a user-friendly interface for model validation
3. Tracks validation history and results
4. Enables collaborative validation workflows
5. Manages user access and permissions

## Core Functionality
1. User Authentication & Authorization
   - Email and Google login support
   - Role-based access control
   - API key management

2. Model Management
   - Model registration
   - Model search and listing
   - Individual model pages
   - Validation history

3. Validation Process
   - Multi-step validation workflow:
     - Dataset characteristics
     - Dataset selection
     - Performance metrics
     - Validation metrics
   - Resubmission capability
   - Shared validation support

4. Administrative Features
   - User management
   - Role assignment
   - System monitoring

## Integration Points
1. Database (PostgreSQL) for data persistence
2. External authentication providers
